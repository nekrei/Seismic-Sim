# Progress log — spec 7 (synthetic earthquake)

## Task 1: Core physics (`apply_synthetic_earthquake_scaling`)

Added to `mdof_response.py`: `apply_synthetic_earthquake_scaling()` plus
`DEFAULT_EPICENTER_DISTANCE_KM`/`DEFAULT_EPICENTER_DEPTH_KM`/
`ATTENUATION_Q`/`ATTENUATION_VELOCITY_MPS`. Wrote
`claude_scripts/verify_synthetic_earthquake.py` (checks 1-3 runnable
immediately, check 4 deferred to Task 3's server.py wiring).

Verification: checks 1-3 run directly, all PASS (identity at defaults
across all 10 records; exact 10x ratio at M0+1; R=R0 ratio=1, R=5*R0
low-f ratio 0.1877 > high-f ratio 0.0005).

Ruling: `claude_scripts/` is fully gitignored in this project, so the
verify script is never committed -- only `mdof_response.py` went into
commit `e732231`.

## Task 2: Bake `reference_magnitude` into `out/`

`save_building_data()` gained a `reference_magnitude` param + JSON field.
`__main__` loads `data/richter readings.json` into `RICHTER_READINGS`,
looks up per-folder, threads into both `save_building_data()` and
`ground_accel_data`. Regenerated all 10 records.

Verification: `git diff --stat` matched the expected shape exactly (one
added line per `building_data.json`, single-line-JSON rewrite per
`ground_accel.json`); spot-checked ANZA1_CIDLA by hand -- only the new
field changed, value 4.92 matches richter readings.json. Committed as
`d83f476`.

## Task 3: `server.py` wiring

Extended `_validate_params` with `epicenter_distance_km`/
`epicenter_depth_km`/`richter_magnitude` (already present from an earlier
pass); `/compute` now calls `apply_synthetic_earthquake_scaling()` on both
axes' ground acceleration before `compute_response()`, and echoes
`reference_magnitude`/`richter_magnitude`/`epicenter_distance_km`/
`epicenter_depth_km` in the response header.

Bug found and fixed during this task: unconditionally re-integrating
displacement from the (possibly reshaped) acceleration broke `/compute`
parity with `out/` even at default Earthquake Parameters, because
`ground_accel.json`'s cached `X_disp`/`Y_disp` is sometimes the actually
recorded DT2 displacement (`parse_peer_displacement_file`), not
acceleration's double integral -- the two differ by ~7.6e-5 m at their
peak, which propagated past check 4's floor-response tolerance. Fixed by
gating: displacement is only re-derived via `_integrate_accel()` when the
requested Earthquake Parameters actually deviate from identity
(magnitude != reference, or distance/depth != defaults); at defaults the
cached displacement is reused unchanged, exactly like before spec 7.

Verification: `claude_scripts/verify_synthetic_earthquake.py` — all 4
checks PASS (identity, magnitude scaling, distance attenuation, /compute
parity at defaults). Committed as `1e60361`.

## Task 4: `index.html` Earthquake Parameters panel

Removed the Amplify `<ctrl-row>` from Playback; added an "Earthquake
Parameters" `<details>` section (Epicenter Dist./Depth sliders, Magnitude
slider) between Building Parameters and View. New DOM refs, `DEFAULT_
EPICENTER_DISTANCE_KM`/`DEFAULT_EPICENTER_DEPTH_KM` JS constants (match
`mdof_response.py`'s), `currentRecordName`/`currentReferenceMagnitude`
module state, `earthquakeParamsAtDefault()` extending
`buildingParamsAtDefault()`, three slider handlers wired into
`scheduleLiveRecompute(true)`. `applyLoadedData()` now resets the Richter
default + epicenter sliders only on an actual record switch (not a
same-record Earthquake Parameter drag). `liveRecompute`'s POST body and
`/compute`'s two `applyLoadedData` call sites now carry
`epicenter_distance_km`/`epicenter_depth_km`/`richter_magnitude` and
`reference_magnitude` respectively.

Ruling: the plan's Step 7 calls `updateEpicenterMap()`, which Task 6
defines -- added a temporary no-op stub in Task 4 (JS function hoisting
means the eventual real definition works fine regardless of file order)
so Task 4 could be tested and committed on its own rather than leaving a
ReferenceError until Task 6 lands. Task 6 will replace the stub.

Ruling: `sliderPosToAmplify()`/`amplifyToSliderPos()` had no remaining
callers once the Amplify slider was removed (amplify is auto-computed via
`setAmplify()` elsewhere) -- deleted as dead code rather than left in
place, along with the now-unneeded `AMPLIFY_SLIDER_MAX` constant.

Verification: real-browser pass (Claude in Chrome) against
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/` served from this worktree (killed two stale
server processes squatting on port 8000 from earlier sessions first).
Confirmed: Amplify row is gone; Earthquake Parameters panel opens and
shows the record's own reference magnitude (4.9 M for ANZA1_CIDLA, not a
hardcoded default); dragging Magnitude to 9.0 M triggers a live recompute
with visibly stronger sway and an active shaking meter; zero console
errors on page load or after the interaction. Committed as `116fe79`.

## Task 5: `index.html` live Input trace frequency-domain drawer

Added `computeInputSpectrum()` -- derives the ground *acceleration*
magnitude spectrum from ground *displacement* via frequency-domain
double differentiation (`|accel(f)| = omega^2 * |disp(f)|`) at
`logBinSpectrum`'s own bin-center frequencies, same technique already
used for furniture's absolute-acceleration input. `redrawSpectrumPanels()`
now branches: at default Earthquake Parameters it uses the exact cached
`spectrum.json` acceleration spectrum unchanged; otherwise it uses
`computeInputSpectrum()`'s live approximation. Unified both shapes into
one `gSpec = { fHz, mag, dt, nyquist_Hz }` object so the rest of the
function (transfer function, output spectrum, draw calls) doesn't care
which source it came from.

## Task 6: Epicenter cross-section map

Replaced the Task 4 `updateEpicenterMap()` no-op stub with the real
implementation: a small always-visible fixed-position overlay (CSS-only,
`#epicenterMap`) with a circular plan view (epicenter distance -> dot
radius from a fixed center building mark, illustrative fixed angle since
the model has no azimuth input) plus a separate vertical depth gauge
(own channel, since the circular view has no room left for a second
distance-like axis). Magnitude drives a CSS `@keyframes` pulse's
period/scale via two custom properties (`--pulse-duration`,
`--pulse-scale`) set from JS -- decorative, not physics. Wired into all
three Earthquake Parameter slider handlers and record load.

Verification (Tasks 5+6 combined): `node --check` on the extracted
`<script type="module">` block (syntax clean), then
`claude_scripts/fft_check.mjs` + `claude_scripts/fft_check_scipy.py` --
all 4 checks PASS (complex FFT and binned-spectrum agreement with
`scipy.fft` to ~3e-14 relative error at two lengths), confirming Task 5's
reuse of the existing FFT/binning path didn't regress it. Committed as
`1f11903`, together with the bug fix below (found while testing this
work in a real browser, so fixed in the same commit rather than filed
separately).

## Bug found + fixed: unbounded attenuation amplification (commit `1f11903`)

Real-browser testing at an extreme Earthquake Parameters combo
(distance=1km, depth=1km, magnitude=8.9) made the building vanish
entirely -- console showed no errors, but peak floor displacement read
**11,875,958.984 mm (~11.9 km)**. Root cause:
`apply_synthetic_earthquake_scaling()`'s anelastic-attenuation term
(`mdof_response.py`) computed `exp(-pi*f*(R-R0)*1000/(Q*v))` -- correct
for R > R0 (decay), but when the requested hypocenter is *closer* than
the reference geometry (R < R0, as at this combo: R=hypot(1,1)=1.41km,
R0=hypot(20,10)=22.36km), `(R-R0)` goes negative and the exponent flips
positive, so the term stops attenuating and starts **amplifying** high
frequencies without bound (12,097x at 100 Hz for this exact combo,
confirmed with a standalone numpy check). This blows up whatever
high-frequency noise floor is in the recorded trace, since there's no
real source spectrum to "restore" -- you can't recover energy the
reference recording already lost to real-world attenuation.

Fix: clamped the exponent to `<= 0` (`max(R - R0, 0.0)`) -- R <= R0 now
means "no attenuation adjustment" (factor 1, same as identity), never
amplification. This is the physically correct treatment: Q attenuation
can only remove energy the recorded trace still has.

Verification: `claude_scripts/verify_synthetic_earthquake.py`'s 4 checks
still all PASS after the fix (identity, magnitude scaling, distance
attenuation ratio, `/compute` parity at defaults -- none of those
exercise R < R0, so this is a real regression-safety confirmation, not
just "didn't break the tests that already covered this"). Standalone
check at the exact bug combo: peak floor displacement dropped from
~11.9km to ~226m (large -- a M8.9 quake 1km away is genuinely
catastrophic in this model's own magnitude/geometric-spreading scaling
-- but now bounded/consistent with the model's own math instead of an
unbounded numerical artifact). Confirmed in a real browser: building
renders and animates normally at this combo post-fix.

## Bug found + fixed: building drifts off-center at extreme parameters (commit `d96a5de`)

After the attenuation fix above, the user reported a second, related bug
at the *same* distance=1km/depth=1km/magnitude=8.9 combo: the building no
longer vanishes, but now visibly drifts away from the camera's fixed
center as playback progresses, instead of swaying in place. Root cause:
`index.html`'s `AMPLIFY_MIN = 1` constant. The auto-scale amplify formula
(`TARGET_SWAY_FRACTION * storyHeight / peakAbsDisp`, in
`applyLoadedData()`) is supposed to keep on-screen sway legible
regardless of the earthquake's actual physical magnitude -- for real
recorded earthquakes `peakAbsDisp` is always mm-cm scale, so the computed
amplify is always >> 1 and `AMPLIFY_MIN` never binds. But post-fix, this
combo's *legitimate* peak floor displacement (~226m, see above) makes the
mathematically correct amplify fall to ~0.005 -- and the `AMPLIFY_MIN=1`
floor silently forced it back up to 1, reapplying ~190x more
amplification than the auto-scale formula intended, which is what sent
the building swinging far off-center rather than staying centered.

Fix: lowered `AMPLIFY_MIN` to `1e-6` (a true division-by-zero guard, not
a value that can plausibly bind for any realistic target sway) so the
auto-scale formula's own math is trusted at extreme magnitudes instead of
being overridden.

Verification: real browser, same combo (distance=1km, depth=1km,
magnitude=8.9) -- building now stays centered and sways visibly in view
through at least 5s of playback (previously drifted off within that
window), zero console errors. `node --check` confirmed no syntax
regression from the edit.

## Next

Task 7: real-browser verification pass against
`verification/07-synthetic-earthquake.md` sections 6-8 (full checklist,
not just the two bugs above -- those were caught incidentally while
testing Task 4/5/6, not from a systematic pass through the verification
doc yet). Task 8: docs/tooling checklist (README, math PDF,
`claude_scripts/math-pdf-sections-goal5.md`-style notes file for spec 7 if
the PDF needs new equations, `AGENTS.md`, `graphify update .`).

**Before starting Task 7**, re-run the full `claude_scripts/
verify_synthetic_earthquake.py` suite once more (last run was before the
two bug-fix commits above touched `mdof_response.py`/`index.html` again)
just to have a fresh clean PASS on record, then do the systematic
real-browser pass. Also worth deliberately re-testing 2-3 *other* extreme
corners of the Earthquake Parameters space (e.g. max distance + max
depth + low magnitude; default distance/depth + max magnitude) since the
two bugs found so far were both specific to the "very close + very
strong" corner -- there could be a third issue lurking in a corner not
yet tried (e.g. very large R relative to R0, where `spreading_scale =
R0/R` gets very small -- check it doesn't collapse to zero/NaN at
`distance_km=200, depth_km=100`).

## Task 7: Systematic real-browser verification pass

Ran `claude_scripts/verify_synthetic_earthquake.py` fresh first (per the
checkpoint's step 1) -- all 4 checks still PASS post-bugfix commits.

Deliberately tested 2-3 extreme corners beyond the one already found buggy
(per checkpoint step 2), all in a real browser (Claude in Chrome) against
this worktree's `server.py`:
- Max distance (200km) alone: T1 unchanged (1.06s/0.95s), epicenter dot
  moved outward, zero console errors.
- Max depth (100km) alone: same, plus depth gauge (separate channel from
  the circular distance dot) moved to its own max independently.
- Max distance + max depth + max magnitude (9.0M) together: stable, no
  NaN/blowup, T1 unchanged -- confirms the far corner opposite the
  previously-fixed R<R0 amplification bug is also safe (large R relative
  to R0 doesn't collapse `spreading_scale` to zero/NaN).
- Magnitude alone at max (9.0M), distance/depth held at exact defaults
  (20km/10km, reloaded page to confirm): T1 unchanged, epicenter dot
  position unchanged (only the pulse animation reacts), zero console
  errors -- confirms the three sliders are genuinely independent.
- Re-tested the original bug corner (dist=1km, depth=1km, mag=9.0, close
  to the exact combo that produced both prior bugs): building renders
  centered and bounded (epicenter map correctly reads "1 km - 1 km"),
  peak floor displacement 284,659mm (~285m) -- matches the magnitude-scale
  math almost exactly against the previously-documented ~226m at M=8.9
  (226 * 10^(9.0-8.9) = 284.5m predicted vs 284.66m measured), an
  independent confirmation of check 2's exact-10x-per-magnitude-unit rule
  using a real end-to-end browser render, not just the offline script.

Worked through verification doc sections 6-8 systematically:

**Section 6** (live sliders): each of the 3 sliders tested individually
(above) -- no console errors, T1 fixed. Amplify slider/label confirmed
absent from Playback in every panel screenshot this session. Sway stays
visible (not off-screen/invisible) at the extreme close/large combo.
Dragged Column X (a Building Parameter) while the extreme earthquake combo
was still active: building stayed centered, no sudden sway rescale, T1
correctly shifted to 1.01s/0.93s reflecting the stiffer column, zero
console errors -- confirms auto-scale re-trigger stays correctly scoped to
Earthquake Parameter changes only, not Building Parameters (no regression
of existing spec 2/4 behavior).

**Section 7** (epicenter map): confirmed always visible (verified via
`getBoundingClientRect()`) with the Earthquake Parameters section
collapsed. Distance/depth drag independently (already covered above --
dot moves horizontally, a separate depth gauge moves vertically, matching
the spec's "own channel" design). Richter slider's pulse animation
measured programmatically via computed `--pulse-duration`/`--pulse-scale`
custom properties, not just eyeballed: 2.20s/1.80 at M=3.0 (min) vs.
0.60s/3.20 at M=9.0 (max) -- both get faster and larger with magnitude, as
designed. Mobile breakpoint (`@media (max-width: 600px)`) rule confirmed
via stylesheet inspection (`#epicenterMap { width: 128px }` vs. 168px
default) and simulated by injecting it directly, since Claude in Chrome
can't resize the window (same limitation/workaround spec 6 already
documented) -- map is `position: fixed` anchored top-right, the mobile
bottom sheet is anchored to the viewport bottom, so overlap is
structurally impossible regardless of exact sheet height.

**Section 8** (frequency-domain drawer under synthetic scaling): opened
the drawer with the extreme combo active (dist=1km, depth=1km, mag=9.0).
Input trace visibly differed in shape from the default-record trace
(confirms it's recomputed live per Part B4, not stale `spectrum.json`).
Wrote a throwaway script,
`claude_scripts/verify_synth_spectrum_identity.py` (reuses
`verify_spectrum.py`'s `check_identity()` math, swapping in
`apply_synthetic_earthquake_scaling()`-reshaped accel/disp at this same
extreme combo) to numerically re-run goal 6's own identity check
(`|FFT(u_rel)| == |T(jw)| * |A_g(jw)|`) against reshaped ground motion
instead of the static default. **Result: max rel err 2.9e-15 on the
padded/exact grid** -- the only grid `verify_spectrum.py` itself gates on
(threshold 1e-9) -- matching goal 6's own precision at defaults. Confirms
the identity isn't accidentally broken by synthetic reshaping; the two
code paths (Input's frequency-domain double-differentiation of reshaped
ground displacement, and the *unchanged* transfer function) still combine
correctly.

Final network/console check across the whole session: all 9 `/compute`
POSTs returned 200, zero console errors captured in the full 216-message
buffer (all LOG-level, none ERROR/NaN/Infinity).

**Ruling**: `verify_synth_spectrum_identity.py`'s grid (b) (trimmed,
measured-only per `verify_spectrum.py`'s own documented precedent) showed
a higher max rel err (7.3%) than an arbitrary 5% threshold I first tried --
not a real problem, just this project's own established precedent that
grid (b) is loose due to FFT leakage from the truncated free-vibration
tail and was never meant to be hard-gated (only grid (a) is, at 1e-9).
Rewrote the check to report grid (b) and gate only on grid (a), matching
`verify_spectrum.py`'s own structure exactly rather than inventing a new
threshold.

Task 7 complete -- all of sections 6-8 pass. Next: Task 8 (docs/tooling
checklist).

## Task 8: docs/tooling checklist

- README.md updated (glossary entries for Richter magnitude/epicenter
  distance-depth/geometric spreading/anelastic attenuation; the Amplify
  glossary entry rewritten to reflect there being no manual slider;
  index.html section documents the new Earthquake Parameters panel and
  the Frequency Domain drawer's live reaction to it; a Current State
  changelog entry covers the panel, the epicenter map, and the R<=R0
  attenuation-clamp bug fix).
- Math PDF source notes written at
  `claude_scripts/math-pdf-sections-goal7.md` (Part E, sections E1-E6),
  matching the beginner-friendly style of `math-pdf-sections-goal5.md`:
  the frequency-domain framing, the literal Richter amplitude-ratio
  definition, geometric spreading, anelastic attenuation as a genuine
  per-frequency filter (and why the R<=R0 clamp is a physical necessity,
  not a numerical safety valve), and a section explaining why the
  on-screen sway still looks calm at most instants even at extreme
  parameters (real earthquakes are inherently peaky; both scale factors
  are frequency-uniform so they cannot change that peakiness; the
  auto-scale normalizes to the single global peak) -- not a bug, a
  documented property of the existing spec 2 auto-scale design.
- `AGENTS.md`'s own spec 7 status line intentionally NOT touched here --
  per this project's convention it only gets marked done in the main
  checkout after the user actually merges (see the goal skill's
  checkpoint note); still says "not yet implemented" in this worktree's
  copy, which is expected.
- `graphify update .` run -- 104 nodes, 131 edges, 8 communities, clean.
- No new dependency was added by this spec, so `requirements.txt` needs no
  change.
- `seismic-sim-backend` mirror is still owed once merged (server.py's
  `/compute` gained the epicenter/magnitude params in Task 3, and
  mdof_response.py gained `apply_synthetic_earthquake_scaling()` in Task
  1) -- to be called out in the final report, not done here.

Task 8 complete. Next: final whole-branch review pass against the spec
and verification doc, then checkpoint stage `verify`, then the finish
menu.
